Traffic Steering
================

This repository contains the source for the RIC traffic steering application.

This xApp can be onboarded through the xApp Onboarder.  The xapp descriptor 
is under the xapp-descriptor/ directory.

Then the xapp can be deployed through the App Manager.

In order for Traffic Steering xApp to carry out the Traffic Steering Use Case,
the following needs to be done:
* QP xApp needs to be onboarded and deployed (see xapp descriptor in that repo)
* QP Driver xApp needs to be onboarded and deployed (see xapp descriptor in that repo)
* SDL must contain network data

Mock network data
=================

Currently, there is no xapp available to receive RAN metrics and write to SDL.

The Traffic Steering Use Case can be run with mock data.  Everything needed to write this
mock data is included in this repo.  Directions are as follows:

cd test/populatedb

chmod a+x populate_db.sh

./populate_db.sh

This script will build a docker image locally and also install a helm chart in the kubernetes cluster to run the image.

The code that is run will write the necessary data to SDL
